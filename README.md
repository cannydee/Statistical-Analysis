Studies show that women suffer more severe and frequent Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) than men; also, young people ages 15 to 24 account for half of all new STDs.

This work examined and evaluated reported cases of Sexually Transmitted Diseases in the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Owerri, 2006-2015. The data collected were classified according to Age Groups; 0-20, 21-40, 41-60, and 61-above years, Gender; Male and Female for Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Gonorrhea, Urethritis, HIV/AIDS, Syphilis and Others.

The Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) and Hotelling's T2 test were employed to analyze the data according to Age Group and Gender respectively. MANOVA showed a significant difference in the incidence of STDs among the Age Groups; the Least Significant Difference (LSD) test was used to determine which Age Groups were significantly different.

Hotelling's T2 test showed that there is no significant difference in the incidence of STDs due to Gender.

Also, the Trend Analysis carried out revealed that the fight against STDs has been effective for Gonorrhea, Urethritis and Others over the years but Urethritis recently experienced an upward movement.
